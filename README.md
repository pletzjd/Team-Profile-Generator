The goal of this assignment was create a javascript file that when run in the terminal would prompt the user for information about various team members and then created an html page to neatly display each team member and their information.
## Usage

To run the program type 'node index.js' in the terminal. Answer all question so that all the fields in the html are properly filled out. The new html file will be created in the dist folder with the name of portfolio.html.
